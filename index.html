100 drivers over 79 hours from 5 vehicles. 100-Driver involves
different types of variations that closely meet the real-world
applications, including changes in the vehicle, person, camera
view, lighting and modality. We provide a detailed analysis of 100-Driver and present 4 settings for investigating practical problems
of DDC, including the traditional setting without domain shift
and 3 challenging settings (i.e., cross-modality, cross-view, and cross-vehicle) with domain shifts. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on these 4 settings with state-the-of-art techniques
and show several insights to the future study of DDC. Our 100-Driver will be publicly available offering new opportunities to advance the development of DDC. "

                Distracted driver classification (DDC) plays an important role in ensuring driving safety. Although many datasets are introduced to support the study of DDC, most of them are
small in data size and are short of diversity in environmental variations. This largely limits the development of DDC since
many practical problems such as the cross-modality setting
cannot be fully studied. In this paper, we introduce 100-Driver,
a large-scale, diverse posture-based distracted diver dataset,
with more than 470K images taken by 4 cameras observing
100 drivers over 79 hours from 5 vehicles. 100-Driver involves
different types of variations that closely meet the real-world
applications, including changes in the vehicle, person, camera
view, lighting and modality. We provide a detailed analysis of 100-Driver and present 4 settings for investigating practical problems
of DDC, including the traditional setting without domain shift
and 3 challenging settings (i.e., cross-modality, cross-view, and cross-vehicle) with domain shifts. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on these 4 settings with state-the-of-art techniques
and show several insights to the future study of DDC. Our 100-Driver will be publicly available offering new opportunities to advance the development of DDC.</p>
